# Description
This repository tracks Chael's solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)! I'm trying to get as many days solved as possible, and not necessarily trying to get the most stars or points. All solutions will (hopefully) be uploaded on YouTube!

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

# Installation
1. run `rbenv install` to install ruby 3
1. run `gem install bundler` for version management
1. run `bundle install` to install gems (mostly RSpec)

# Usage
There are two ways to run a solution.

1. `ruby ./days/day_one.rb` This runs as a script
1. `bundle exec rspec spec/day_one_spec.rb` This runs the test suite with descriptive output
